Accessibility
=============

Vermont Rental Codes is committed to providing a Web site that's accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We work to increase the accessibility and usability of our site, and, in doing so, adhere to many of the available standards and guidelines.

Section 508
-----------

Vermont Rental Codes endeavours to conform to the electronic and information technology accessibility standards as described in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act.

These guidelines explain how to make Web content more accessible for people with disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the Web more user-friendly for all people.

W3C standards
-------------

This site has been built using code compliant with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards for "XHTML 1.0 Strict" and cascading style sheets (CSS). The site displays correctly in current standards-compliant browsers and using standards-compliant XHTML/CSS code means future browsers will also display it correctly.

### Exceptions

While Vermont Rental Codes strives to adhere to accepted guidelines and standards for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in all areas of the Web site.

We are continually seeking solutions that will bring all areas of the site up to the same level of overall accessibility. In the meantime should you experience any difficulty in accessing vermontrentalcodes.org, don't hesitate to [contact us](contact.html).
