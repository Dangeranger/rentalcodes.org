Renting out your property
-------------------------

### What landlords can and cannot consider when selecting tenants

Under state and federal Fair Housing laws, you cannot take race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, the presence of minor children, receipt of public assistance, or gender identity into consideration when deciding to rent to a tenant. Discrimination on the basis of any one or more of these categories can result in an investigation and/or a lawsuit.

However, there are some characteristics you can take into consideration, such as objectionable behavior in prior rentals or past failure to pay rent.

You are also required to make certain types of accommodations for tenants with disabilities.
