Before renting
==============

The following is a summary of the **minimum health and safety building standards a property must meet before it can be rented** in accordance with the Vermont Departments of Health and Public Safety. Rented mobile homes must also meet these requirements. Depending on the age of a rental property, some regulations may apply differently. For the complete details on each requirement and definitions of key terms, see the [Vermont Rental Housing Code](http://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/REG_Rental_Housing_Code.pdf) and the [Vermont Fire and Building Safety Code](http://firesafety.vermont.gov/sites/firesafety/files/files/rules/dfs_rules_firecode2015_current.pdf).

Some municipalities have their own local health and/or safety codes that may include stronger standards and more detailed requirements. (See ["Communities with local codes."](../../resources/communities-with-local-codes.html)) Landlords and tenants should contact their local health officer, town clerk's office, or the local Board of Health for more information on local regulations. This information does not constitute a legal opinion or advice.
