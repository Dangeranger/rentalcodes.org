Before renting
--------------

Before your landlord can rent to you, the rental property must meet these health and safety building standards under the Vermont Departments of Health and Public Safety. Your landlord is also responsible for ensuring the property continues to meet these standards throughout your tenancy. Before moving into a property, tenants are recommended to get an inspection of the unit to ensure it meets these minimum health and safety requirements.

Renting residential property in Vermont
---------------------------------------

### What landlords can and cannot consider when selecting tenants

Under state and federal Fair Housing laws, landlords cannot take race, religion, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, the presence of minor children, receipt of public assistance, or gender identity into consideration when deciding whether to rent to you. If a landlord is found to be discriminating on the basis of any one or more of these categories, it can result in an investigation and/or lawsuit for that landlord.

However, there is some information landlords can consider when deciding whether to rent to you. This information includes past rental history, such as failure to pay rent.
