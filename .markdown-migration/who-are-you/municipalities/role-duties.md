Town health officer duties in residential rental housing
--------------------------------------------------------

Town health officers are often called up on to inspect rental property. Once contacted, the town health officer is responsible for checking the property to verify that it meets the [Vermont Rental Housing Health Code](http://www.healthvermont.gov/sites/default/files/REG_Rental_Housing_Code.pdf). The role of the health officer is then to identify code violations and enforce compliance.
