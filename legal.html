					        <p>Vermont Rental Codes collects certain information from and about

					        <ol style="list-style:lower-alpha;">
					          <li>
								<h4>Web server logs</h4>
					            When you visit our Web site, we may track information to administer 
					            the site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track 
					            include:

					              <li>Your Internet protocol address</li>

					            <h4>Use of cookies</h4>
					            Vermont Rental Codes may use cookies to personalize or enhance 
					              your user experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed 
					              on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to 
					              run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely 
					              assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web Server in the domain 
					              that issued the cookie to you.<br /><br />
					            One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience 
					              feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web 
					              page, or navigate within a site, a cookie helps the site to recall 
					              your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this simplifies 
					              the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation 
					              by providing and saving your preferences and login information as 
					              well as providing personalized functionality.<br /><br />
					            Vermont Rental Codes reserves the right to share aggregated site 
					              statistics with partner companies, but does not allow other companies 
					              to place cookies on our Web site unless there is a temporary, overriding 
					              customer value (such as merging into rentalcodes.org a 
					              site that relies on third-party cookies).<br /><br />
					            You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers 
					              automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser 
					              setting to decline cookies. If you reject cookies by changing your 
					              browser settings then be aware that this may disable some of the 
					              functionality on our Web site.</li>

					          <li>
					            <h4>Personal information users</h4>
					            Visitors to our Web site can register to purchase services. When 
					              you register, we will request some personal information such as 
					              name, address, email, telephone number or facsimile number, account 
					              number and other relevant information. If you are purchasing a service, 
					              we will request financial information. Any financial information 
					              we collect is used only to bill you for the services you purchased. 
					              If you purchase by credit card, this information may be forwarded 
					              to your credit card provider. For other types of registrations, 
					              we will ask for the relevant information. You may also be asked 
					              to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance 
					              and information to you. For example, such data may be warranted 
					              in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.<br /><br />
					            We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect 
					              from you to third parties without your permission except to the 
					              extent necessary including:<br /><br />
					            <ul>
					              <li>To fulfill your service requests for services;</li>
					              <li>To protect ourselves from liability;</li>

					              <li>To respond to legal process or comply with law; or</li>
					              <li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of 
					                the company</li>
					            </ul></li>
					        </ol></li>
					      <li>
							<h3>Use of Web beacons or gif files</h3>
					        <p>Vermont Rental Codes Web pages may contain electronic images known 
					          as Web beacons &#8212; sometimes also called single-pixel gifs &#8212; 
					          that allow Vermont Rental Codes to count users who have visited those 
					          pages and to deliver co-branded services. Vermont Rental Codes may 
					          include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or newsletters in 
					          order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.</p>

					        <p>Some of these Web beacons may be placed by third party service providers 
					          to help determine the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns or 
					          email communications. These Web beacons may be used by these service 
					          providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows 
					          the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit 
					          certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation 
					          to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers 
					          to learn which advertisements and emails bring you to our Web site and 
					          how you use the site. Vermont Rental Codes prohibits Web beacons from 
					          being used to collect or access your personal information.</p>
					      </li>
					      <li>
							<h3>Accessing Web account information</h3>
					        <p>We will provide you with the means to ensure that personally identifiable 
					          information in your web account file is correct and current. You may 
					          review this information by <a href="contact.html">contacting us</a>.</p></li> 
					      <li>
							<h4>Changes to this statement</h4>

					        <p>Vermont Rental Codes has the discretion to occasionally update this 
					          privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "updated" date 
					          at the top of this Privacy page. We encourage you to periodically review 
					          this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to 
					          protect the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the 
					          service constitutes your agreement to this privacy statement and any 
					          updates.</p>
