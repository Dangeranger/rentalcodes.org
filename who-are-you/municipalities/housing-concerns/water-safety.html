					<h1>Water safety</h1>
					<p>A public water supply is a system that has at least 15 connections and/or serves 25 people for at least 60 days a year. All water systems that fit into the designation of a public water supply are tested for contaminants on a regular basis and community systems are required to send yearly Consumer Confidence Reports (CCR) to their customers.</p>
					<p>Private water supplies are water sources that serve single family homes or small groups of homes and are typically monitored and maintained by their owners. Although a large number of rental properties use water provided by public water systems, there are still many that are on private wells or springs.</p>
					<p>Although private water supplies are not regulated, the Vermont Department of Health recommends:</p>
					<ul>
						 <li>Yearly testing for coliform bacteria</li>
						 <li>Testing for inorganic chemicals every five years</li>
						 <li>Testing for naturally-occurring alpha radiation every five years</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Role of the town health officer</h2>
					<p>The town health officer's role in drinking water in rental housing is primarily focused on assuring that tenants using private drinking water sources are provided with safe water.</p>
					<p>Under the <a class="outsideLink" href="http://healthvermont.gov/regs/Rental_Housing_Code.pdf">Residential Rental Housing Code</a>, Vermont tenants are entitled to a potable water source. Town health officers may become involved with private water supplies if contacted about the contamination of a private drinking water source or simply to assist homeowners by giving them educational information or referral sources.</p>
					<p>Town health officers will typically not become involved with situations concerning public water supplies as they are regulated by the Department of Environmental Conservation's Water Supply Division.</p>

					<h2>Procedures for investigation of private source drinking water issue</h2>
					<p>Once a town health officer has received a complaint about a possible water safety issue in a rental property, the town health officer should:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><strong>Determine if water source is public or private.</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>Tenants are entitled to an adequate supply of safe drinking water. If a rental property uses water from a public water supply, the safety of the water is already being verified and it is not necessary for the town health officer to become involved.</li>
								<li>If contacted by a customer of a public water supply, the town health officer should direct the caller to contact their water supplies or the Water Supply Division at (800) 823-6500.</li>
								<li>When the drinking water for a rental property comes from a private water supply, the quality of drinking water is not guaranteed and town health officers may be called upon to assure the safety of the water supply.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Once a complaint has been received about a <em>private water source</em>, a town health officer may <strong>seek voluntary cooperation of the property owner to get water tested</strong>. The Vermont Department of Health offers <a class="outsideLink" href="http://healthvermont.gov/enviro/ph_lab/water_test.aspx">laboratory analyses, guidance, and technical advice on treatment options</a>: <a class="outsideLink" href="http://healthvermont.gov/enviro/ph_lab/documents/watertestform1008.pdf">Water and Radon Test Order Form</a>.</li>
						<li>If a property owner refuses to cooperate with recommended water testing, a town health officer may <strong>seek a health order</strong>. For more information on health orders, <a href="../process-procedure.html">see the General Process and Procedure section of this website</a>.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For more information on how to proceed with an investigation of a private water source, see the Vermont Department of Health's Environmental Health section.
